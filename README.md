# Backend with Laravel
<p align="center"><a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laravel/art/master/logo-lockup/5%20SVG/2%20CMYK/1%20Full%20Color/laravel-logolockup-cmyk-red.svg" width="400" alt="Laravel Logo"></a></p>

This project explores the features of Laravel - a framework for php - and docker environments as well as AWS(Amazon Web Services). 

Out of the box, Laravel features an extensive range of features including automated route collections, and a handful of pre-defined middlewares for validation and user authentication. 

Both front- and backend were implemented using laravel with a frontend library called `Blade`, that ships with Laravel. 

For the database, a mysql server was deployed as a docker container alongside the backend demo application. Overall, the application is structured as a multi-container docker service.

## Processes

- Laravel utilizes a LOT of different services and libraries such as `AlpineJS` or `Node`. These are all configured on a new project and bootstrapped to provide an integrated developing environment. 

- a CLI tool called `artisan` is provided to automate the creation of certain elements.

    For example, 
    ```
    php artisan make:controller RatingController
    ```
    will initiate a RatingController.php script that extends the `Controller` class.

### Users
Laravel provides a template for new projects, which is by itself already a complete webapp(so to speak). A user system with profile editing features is already implemented with a dashboard display that shows up when a user logs in.

### Rating
Building from this template, I only had to add a rating system and an appropriate front end interface. Once again, the `artisan` CLI facilitates the creation of `Model`s, which are objects that handle database queries under the hood.
```
php artisan make:Model Ratings
```
creates a [Rating.php](app/Models/Rating.php) under the `/Models/` directory. This file is simply a template, so it needs to filled out. 
By default, Laravel protects against CSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery). The user entry fields are added to `$fillable` to let laravel know that this is a field that can be entered to the database.
```PHP
# In Rating.php

protected $fillable = [
        'artist',
        'title',
        'stars',
    ];
```
Of course, we can't allow the user to enter whatever they want into the database, so this entry will be validated in [RatingController.php](#input-validation)

Then, we add a relation to the Rating Model by writing
```PHP
# In Rating.php

public function user(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
```
This maps the Rating Model to a User Model in way that a Rating can only belong to a single User.

Likewise, In the User Model, we add a HasMany relation that maps the User Model to multiple Rating Models 
```PHP
# In User.php

public function ratings(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Rating::class);
    }
```

### RatingController

Similar to how a Rating Model was initiated, a Controller is also initiated through the `artisan` CLI. 
```
php artisan make:Controller RatingController
```
creates a `RatingController.php` under `/Controllers/`

In [RatingController.php](/app/Http/Controllers/RatingController.php), certain functions can be declared that laravel automatically gathers HTTP requests from and register adequate routes. These functions are namely `show`, `index`, `store`, etc. 

**Examples**

- The `show()` was implemented to handle individual `GET` requests to each rating. 
- The `store()` method handles `POST` requests to store new ratings to the database. 

### Input Validation

This is where input validation is implemented. In the `store()` method,
```PHP
public function store(Request $request) : RedirectResponse {
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'artist' => 'required|string|max:100',
            'title' => ['required', 'string', 'max:100', 'unique:'.Rating::class],
            'stars' => 'required|integer|lte:5|gte:0',
        ]);

        $request->user()->ratings()->create($validated);

        return redirect(route('ratings.index'));
    }
```
the `validate()` method is called to check if whatever the user inputted through the html form satisfies the restrictions.


This file is also where the frontend files are served. For example, in the `index()` method, which simply handles a `GET` request to the url `Rating`, sends the [index.blade.php](/resources/views/ratings/index.blade.php) under `/resources/views/ratings/index.blade.php`.

### Policies

Laravel also allows the implmentation of custom policies to define which actions are allowed for which users. In this case, policies for ratings were created (also through the `artisan` CLI) to only allow a user to delete or edit ratings that belong to them. This is done in [RatingPolicy.php](app/Policies/RatingPolicy.php)
```PHP
public function update(User $user, Rating $rating): bool
    {
        return $rating->user()->is($user);
    }
```
The above function declares the policy for which user is allowed to update which rating.

### Database migration

Another additional feature offered in laravel. It facilitates the creation of tables into a database such as this 
```PHP
public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('ratings', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
            $table->string('artist');
            $table->string('title')->unique();
            $table->integer('stars');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
```
and by running
```
php artisan migrate
```
laravel will automatically run SQL statements to create appropriate tables.

*Although it seems that this feature was meant to be used during development to facilitate teamwork, It also did not break my production setup.

### Frontend

`Blade` was also a somewhat intuive frontend library to use. It wass very convenient that the new project template included components such as `<x-dropdown-link>` to expedite the creation of reactive frontend components.

## Deployment

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1ada9782cbf79d79a05ce076d897076ccb8a483837c05959b41f82a87c967a4f/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f436972636c6543492d5075626c69632f63696d672d617a7572652f6d61696e2f696d672f636972636c652d646f636b65722e7376673f73616e6974697a653d74727565" width=400 alt="Docker Logo"></a></p>

The application was deployed using docker.

The application image was built using the [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile). A mysql-server image was pulled from the docker hub to handle database operations. A docker network was established between the two containers such that the laravel application and talk to the mysql database.

The app image was built on php:8.1-apache from the docker hub, and further configured to install the server requirements.

## Production

<p align="center"><a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2232217?s=280&v=4" alt="AWS Logo"></a></p>

The application was deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with Route 53 to handle domain routing.

Currently the website is accessible at ~~[comp333-backend-demo.net](comp333-backend-demo.net)~~ ðŸ‘‰ Under construction

## Issues

### Issue #1
The configurable load balancer provided by AWS enables routing https(443) requests to http(80) on the server. 

While I hoped I could get away with not configuring an Apache server or a nginx server by utilizing
```
php artisan serve
```
I learned that this is actually just PHP's built in server and was intended for development purposes. As such, it is incapable of handling https requests. This oversight resulted in the web page's html loading but css and js scripts being blocked by the browser as these are attempting to be served over http while the listener is trying to resolve this connection through https.

### Solutions

1. Setup a cloudfront distribution service on AWS. This will serve the website over front servers provided by AWS which will fetch contents from my EC2 instance.
    
    -> This required CORS enabled in the application, which was not something that sounded safe for an application with authentication features.

2. Reconfigure the backend server that serves the content to use apache or nginx instead of PHP's builtin server.

    -> This probably sounds like the solution.
